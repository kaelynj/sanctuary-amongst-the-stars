# Online Research
---
The mesh is a treasure trove of data for those skilled in exploring its nooks and filtering out the detritus.  Use the [Research skill](../Action%20&%20Combat/Skills.md#Research) when looking things up online.  You can search for news, research papers, public sensor feeds, social network activity, personal information, corporate information, SolArchive entries, criminal records, government data, leaked reports, mesh-connected devices, and much, much more.  Digitized data of all kinds can be searched: text, pictures, audio, video, XP, raw data, software, etc.  This data is culled from all manner of sources: archives, databases, directories, social networks, cloud services, blogs/vlogs, forums, chat rooms, and regular mesh sites.  Research is conducted using various public and private search engines, both general and specialized, as well as data indices and search AIs.

You also use [Research](../Action%20&%20Combat/Skills.md#research) when looking for information on a specific network or device to which you have access: a sensor mote, someone's ecto or tablet, a robot , or an opponent's  mesh inserts (see [Searching Specific Systems](#searching-specific-systems)).  Likewise, since everyone inevitably uses and interacts with the mesh, Research skill is also a way to identify, backtrack, and/or gather information on people as long as they have not hidden their identity with a shroud of disinformation (see [Tracking](Tracking.md)).


# Search Challenges
Due to the sheet amount of data available, finding what you're looking for can be a daunting task.  Thankfully, information is fairly well-organized, thanks to the hard work of "spider" AIs that cruise the mesh and update data and search indices.

Another impediment to online searches is the amount of incorrect data and misinformation.  Much data is simply wrong (mistakes happen) or outdated.  Falsehoods are intentionally perpetuated and spread for memetic warfare purposes.  Hacktivist groups actively seed false data in an effort to combat out-of-control surveillance data mining.  This misinformation can linger for years and propagate far and wide as it is circulated without fact-checking.  To counteract this, many data sources incorporate reputation scores so that untrustworthy or disreputable sources can be identified and ranked lower in search results.  Many archives also harness the collaborative power of mesh users and ALIs to crowdsource verification of their data.
