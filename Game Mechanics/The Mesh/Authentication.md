Mesh security relies heavily on authentication and encryption to identify legitimate users and keep protected data from being intercepted

## Mesh ID
---
Your mesh ID is a unique identifier code that distinguishes you from every other user and device on the mesh.  Your cranial computer or ecto automatically associates this ID address with your accounts and screen names, enabling you to receive messages and other transmissions.  This ID is automatically generated each time you come online and required for almost all online interactions.  These interactions are universally logged, leaving a data trail that can be used to [[Tracking|track your activity]].  Fortunately, [[Services|anonymizing services]] are available for those who value their privacy.

Many mesh IDs are publicly registered (and in some jurisdictions, this is legally mandated).  Looking up a registered mesh ID is trivial.  Registration data may include a name, physical address, and social media profile if so desired.

# Accounts & Access Privileges
---
To access any mesh device or service, you need an account.  Your account links to your mesh ID and determines your access privileges -- what you are allowed to see and do with the device/service.  As some systems are more restrictive than others, the GM ultimately decides what privileges an account provides.  There are four types of accounts: **public**, **user**, **security**, and **admin**.

> [!note] Account Shell
> When you log onto a system, an account shell is created.  This account shell is the user interface that allows you to interact with the system.  This process represents your presence as you access the system.  It can be attacked in [[Mesh Combat]].



## Public Accounts
Public accounts provide access to anyone on the mesh.  They do not require any type of authentication or login process -- your mesh ID is enough.  Public accounts let you browse mesh sites, forums, public archives, open databases, social networks, etc.  Public accounts usually have the ability to view an download public data and sometimes write (forum comments, for example), but little else.


## User Accounts
User accounts require some form of authentication to access the device/service.  These accounts are provided to people who regularly use the system: employees, clients, etc.  Most users are allowed to use the system's standard features as well as view, download, upload, and change their own or shared data.  They are note allowed to create new accounts, access logs, alter security features, or do anything that might impact the system's functions.

## Security Accounts
Security accounts are intended for security personnel and ALIs that watch over the system.  They also require authentication but provide greater privileges than standard users.  Security accounts can typically view and edit logs, command security features and ALIs, add/delete non-admin accounts, alter the data of other users, and so on.
