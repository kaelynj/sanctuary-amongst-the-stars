# Downtime Actions
Not all of your character's actions take place on missions or in scenarios.  In between moments of investigation, tensions, and violence, you may seek to improve yourself, work on projects, or build your social life.  This section covers a range of possible down-time actions you can pursue, though you should work with your GM to discuss other options.


# Rez Points
(Taken from pg., 366) Rez Points (RP) are a method for measuring your character's advancement.  You use them to define how your PC learns and grows, bringing them into a higher resolution, a sharper focus.  They represent learning experiences and growth and the GM determines when to assign them.
