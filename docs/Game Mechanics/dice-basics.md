# Dice Basics
*Eclipse Phase* uses two ten-sided dice for skill tests and most other trolls.  Rolled dice are read as percentiles (d100), with the first die serving as the tens digit and the second as the ones digit.  Percentile dice rolls result in a number between 0 and 99 (00 is read as zero).  A roll of 5 and 3, for example, is read as 53.  Use different colored dice to note which one to read first or use ten-siders made for percentile rolling.


## Difficulty & Modifiers
Fixing a common glitch in your favorite robot isn't as difficult as repairing an unknown malfunction on an unfamiliar model.  These degrees of difficult are represented by *modifiers* -- adjustments that raise or lower the target number.  An easy test provides a positive modifier, increasing the target number.  A hard test inflicts a negative modifier.

Modifiers are assigned in multiples of ten, ranging from +10 to +30 and -10 to -30, as noted on the Modifiers table.  GMs assign modifiers as appropriate to the situation.  If multiple circumstances affect a test, no set of modifiers should impact a test by more than +/-60.

### Modifiers
|Difficulty | Situational Factor | Modifier |
| :--: | :---: | :---: |
| Very Easy|  Major Bonus | +30 |
| Easy | Moderate Bonus | +20 |
| Slightly Easy | Minor Boost | +10 |
| Average | | +/-0 |
| Slightly Hard | Minor Hindrance | -10 |
| Hard | Moderate Impediment | -20 |
| Very Hard | Major Drawback | -30 |

## Superior Results: (33/66 Rule)
Sometimes you will rock your test with flair, sometimes you will fumble it with indignity.  On a roll of 33 or more that succeeds, you get a *superior success*.  On a roll of 66 or more that succeeds, you get two superior successes. On a roll of 66 or less that fails, you get a *superior failure*.  On a failed roll of 33 or less, you get two superior failures.

For each superior result, choose one of the following.  For two superior results, you may choose two of the following or one twice for the double the effect.

- **Quality**: The work is more exact (success) or more sloppy (failure).  This may affect subsequent tests +/-10.
- **Quantity**: The test consumes fewer (success) or more (failure) materials or produces fewer or more results.
- **Detail**: You acquire information that is much more in-depth or nuanced (success) or false (failure).
- **Time (task actions only)**: The action takes a shorter (success) or longer (failure) amount of time, by +/-25%.
- **Covertness**: The action is less (success) or more (failure) obvious or draws less or more attention (+/-10 as appropriate).
- **Damage**: Successes inflict more (+1d6) damage (failures miss).

Use superior results for extra style or oomph factor when making tests.  Superior results may not apply to every dice roll; a binary success/failure is often enough to move the story forward.  This is especially true for tests that fail -- the consequences may be severe enough without needing to know how badly the character screwed up.  GMs make the final call on when/how to apply superior results.


## Criticals
When you roll doubles on a test -- 00, 11, 22, etc. -- you score a *critical* result.  If you roll a critical and succeed, you get a critical success.  If you roll a critical and fail, you score a critical failure.  A roll of 00 is always a critical success and a roll of 99 is always a critical failure, no matter the target number.  Additionally, if a critical is also a superior result, only the critical applies.

Criticals have more impact than superior results.  They represent "Wow!" moments where you stun onlookers with your proficiency or ineptness.  They provide extra bonus effects/penalties, as determined by the GM.  Here are some examples:

- Double the damage you inflict with an attack
- Gain a +/- 20 modifier to the next test you make.
- Take an extra action (critical success) or lose your next action (critical failure).
- Break a weapon/tool (critical failure).

# Defaulting
If you lack the skill you need to make a test, you can rely on your character's innate talents and *default* to the skill's linked aptitude instead.  For example, if you lack the *Guns* skill, you can still shoot using your *Reflexes* (REF) aptitude as the target number.  There is no modifier for defaulting on a skill test, but critical successes are ignored.  The GM may also decide that some tests require specialized knowledge or training and so cannot be defaulted on.

In some cases, the GM may allow you to default to a related skill.  For example, someone trying to repair a gun without any *Hardware* skills could default to their *Guns* skill.  In this case, a -10 to -30 modifier applied, depending on how closely the skills are related.  

# Teamwork
Multiple characters may cooperate on a test, such as pushing open a door or repairing a robot together.  These collaborators must reasonably be able to communicate and work together in an efficient fashion.  Only one character rolls for the test (usually the one with the highest skill).  Each additional contributing character provides a +10 modifier, up to a maximum of +30.  Only the character making the test can use pools to affect the test.

For tests involving Know, Technical, or Vehicle skills, collaborating characters must possess the tested skill at 40 or more to provide a teamwork bonus.

## Types of Tests
There are two main types of tests in *Eclipse Phase*: success and opposed.

### Success Test
Success tests are the most common type of test.  use them whenever your character acts without direct opposition.  Most skill tests, rep network tests, and aptitude checks are handled as success tests and require a quick or complex action to complete.

#### Trying Again
If you fail a test, you may try again, but with a cumulative -10 modifier.  So your first re-try will be at -10, your second at -20, your third at -30 and so on.  In some cases, the GM may rule that re-attempts are not possible, such as situations where you have only one chance to succeed before circumstances change.

### Opposed Test
Opposed tests are called for when you are directly opposed by an NPC or other force.  Negotiating, arm-wrestling, pickpocketing, and combat are all examples of opposed tests.  Opposed tests are more difficult -- you must not only succeed but also beat your opponent.

When making an opposed test, both sides make a test as described above.  Modifiers are applied to whichever side gains an advantage or to both sides if equally affected.

- If one opponent succeeds and the other fails, the successful one wins the contest.
- If both sides roll under their target number, whomever rolls highest wins and succeeds.  The other either fails or succeeds but loses.
- If both sides tie or fail, either the opponents remain deadlocked or the highest roll or skill wins and succeeds (GM's choice)

Critical successes trump high rolls on opposed tests.  If both sides succeed, but the lower roller gets a critical, they pull an upset victory from the clutches of defeat.  If both opponents roll critical successes, the higher roll (or skill if ties) wins with a critical, the loser either fails or succeeds but loses.
