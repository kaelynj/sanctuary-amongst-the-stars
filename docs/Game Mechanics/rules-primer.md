# Rules Primer
Use this page for a quick refresher on the basics of gameplay in *Eclipse Phase*.

## Making Tests
- When asked for a test or check, roll d100 (0-99).  The target number to succeed is the corresponding skill, aptitude check value, or rep score found on your character sheet.  
- The difficulty of these checks are represented by *modifiers* to this target number, assigned by the GM.
- Your goal is to roll equal to or under the modified target number, but as high as possible.
- A roll equal to or under the target number is a success.
  - If the success roll is 33 or more, it is a *superior success*.
  - If the success roll is 66 or more, it is two superior successes.
- If the roll exceeds the target number it is a failure.
  - If the failed roll is under 66, it is a *superior failure*.
  - If the failed roll is under 33, it is two superior failures.
- Doubles (00, 11, 22, etc.) equal a *critical success* or *failure* depending on if the value is below or above the target number.
- 00 is always a critical success.  99 is always a critical failure.
- If you do not have the appropriate skill, you may *default* to the skill's linked aptitude, but critical successes are ignored.
- If you fail, you may try again (unless the GM disallows it), with a cumulative -10 modifier.
