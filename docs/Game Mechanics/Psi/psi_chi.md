# Psi-Chi Sleights
Psi-chi sleights are available to anyone with the Psi trait.  Psi-gamma sleights are only available to characters with the Psi trait at Level 2.  Unless noted, sleights may only be taken once. Psi-chi sleights are passive, always-on, subconscious abilities available to anyone with the Psi trait.  They are considered automatic actions and require no effort to maintain.  Psi-chi sleights add bonuses to specific actions or enable new abilities rather than calling for a skill test.  Most enhance the async's perception, intellect, mental control, or ability to process information.

**Range:** Self, Point-Blank, or Close

**Action:** Automatic, Quick, Complex, or Task

**Duration:** Constant, Instant, Sustained, or your WIL $\div$ 5 in either action turns, minutes, or hours

**Infection Mod:** Added to your Infection Rating.

### Charisma
You inhibitions are lowered, social intuition expanded, and emotional intelligence augmented.  This enhances your ability to navigate social situations and process emotional information.  

*Increase [Moxie](../Action%20&%20Combat/Pools.md#moxie) pool by 1.*


### Control Behavior
You can fine-tune your emotional state.  Apply an [Enhanced Behavior](../../Player%20Resources/Character%20Creation/traits.md#enhanced-behavior) or [Restricted Behavior](../../Player%20Resources/Character%20Creation/traits.md#restricted-behavior) (Level 2) trait of your choice at will.  You may not change it again until you have taken a recharge action.  At the GM's discretion, this trait may apply a +/-10 modifier in some situations.  Alternatively, use this to reduce an Enhanced/Restricted Behavior trait imposed on you by up to two levels.  You can push this sleight to raise the effect to Level 3 (or three levels of reduction).

### Eco-Empathy
With a successful COG Check, you acquire an intuitive understanding of non-sentient, non-terrestrial organisms occupying a producer niche in the local ecosystem (e.g., an alien plant and fungus analogue).  The information you gain is of a general and qualitative nature, and doesn't include data you would normally acquire from chemical or genetic analysis.  For example, you could determine if a plant thrives only in riparian zones, if it relies on insect analogs for pollination, or if it produces tubers that are edible to transhumans when cooked.

### Enhanced Creativity
You are more imaginative and inclined to think outside the box.  Apply a +10 modifier to Know or Technical skill tests where creativity plays a major role.  This level of ingenuity sometimes seems strange and unusual, manifesting as odd insights or creepy details, especially with artwork.

### Enhanced Memory
You have a perfect memory.  Unlike transhumans with hyperthymesia, this is not strictly autobiographical.  You can be asked a random date and immediately recall trivial details such as the day of the week it was, what you did that day, what the weather was like, and the exact wording of a paragraph you read.  Your memory is always "on" -- in fact, you perceive reality and memory much like a split screen and are often caught in reverie.  Enhanced memory has no effect on psychosurgery memory editing.

You can push this sleight to recall your memories from a sort of third-person point of view, allowing you to make [Perceive Tests](../Action%20&%20Combat/Skills.md#perceive) to notice details you may have previously missed.

### Grok
You intuitively understand how to use an unfamiliar object, vehicle, or device, no matter how alien, advanced, or bizarre.  You may make a COG Check to determine how to activate or use it, simply by looking at and handling it.  This sleight does not provide any understanding of the principles or technologies involved -- you simply grasp how to make it work.  This sleight is only effective with unfamiliar devices, it provides no bonus when using devices with which you are familiar.

### Heightened Awareness
Your situational awareness is boosted, providing an instinctive sense about an area and any potential threats nearby.  +10 to [Perceive Tests](../Action%20&%20Combat/Skills.md#perceive).

### High-Pain Threshold
You can block out, ignore, or otherwise isolate pain.  Ignore the modifiers from a single wound (this is cumulative with other effects, up to a maximum of three wound effects).

### Inner Spark
You have an inner well of energy, making it easier to recuperate.  You recover +1 pool points during short recharges.

### Patter Recognition
You are adept at spotting patterns and correlating non-random elements.  This is useful for translating languages, breaking codes, or finding clues hidden among massive amounts of data.  Apply a +10 modifier to appropriate [Infosec](../Action%20&%20Combat/Skills.md#infosec), [Perceive](../Action%20&%20Combat/Skills.md#perceive), or [Research Tests](../The%20Mesh/Research.md#research-tests) where you have a sufficiently large sample and time enough to study, as determined by the GM.  This might range from a few hours of investigating inscriptions left by long-dead aliens to a week or more of researching a lengthy cipher.  This does not apply to brute-force hacking or [Infosec](../Action%20&%20Combat/Skills.md#infosec) tests made by decrypt apps to break a code.  You also learn new languages easily; reduce the timeframe to weeks rather than months.

### Predictive Boost
Your brain's Bayesian probability functions are accelerated, enhancing your ability to estimate and predict the outcomes of events as they unfold in real-time around you.  In effect, you have an intuitive sense for the most likely outcomes.  +2 Initiative.

### Psi Armor
You mind's defenses are solidified.  You gain mental armor equal to your WIL $\div$ 3 against psi attacks.

### Qualia
You have a more intuitive grasp of the world around you.  +1 [Insight Pool](../Action%20&%20Combat/Pools.md#insight).

### Savant Calculation
You have an incredible faculty for intuitive mathematics involving complex, chaotic systems.  You can calculate your odds when gambling, predict the outcome of stock market upheavals, and guesstimate the rubble distribution pattern from an explosion.  You can also measure exact distances with a look, solve math problems faster than computers, and tell how many microbots make up a swarmanoid.  This talent, however, is not conscious, it is intuitive.  You do not know the equations you are solving, you simply know the solution.  You may make COG Checks to calculate answers to complex mathematical questions.

### Scramble
Scramble helps you to hide from another async using the [ego sense](psi_gamma.md#ego-sense) sleight.  Apply a -30 modifier to the async's [Psi Test](../Action%20&%20Combat/Skills.md#psi).

### Self-Control
Your will is tempered and unyielding.  +10 to WIL Checks.

### Social Cunning
Your emotional intelligence is sharpened and focused, making you more manipulative and exploitative of weaknesses.  +10 to [Persuade](../Action%20&%20Combat/Skills.md#persuade) and [Provoke](../Action%20&%20Combat/Skills.md#provoke) tests.

### Somatic Control
You have excellent physiological control.  +1 to [Vigor Pool](../Action%20&%20Combat/Pools.md#vigor).

### Superior Kinesics
You have finer control over your emotive signals, body language, and micro-expressions and are more capable at interpreting the same in others.  +10 to [Deceive](../Action%20&%20Combat/Skills.md#deceive) and [Kinesics](../Action%20&%20Combat/Skills.md#kinesics) tests.

### Xeno-Empathy
You have an intuitive understanding of non-human, non-terrestrial organisms (animal analogues).  You can make a SAV Check to acquire insight into the creature's ecological niche, motivations, needs, and likely behavioral responses (if non-sapient) or mental/emotional state (if sapient).
