# Psi-Gamma Sleights
Psi-gamma sleights influence the function of biological minds (egos within a biomorph, but also including animal life).  Psi-gamma is only available to characters with Level 2 of the Psi trait.  Psi-gamma sleights must be activated, requiring a quick, complex, or task-action and a Psi skill tests.  Sleights that target other sentient beings or life forms are always opposed tests, while others are handled as success tests.  Active sleights require significant effort from the async and may cause their exovirus infection to flare up.

**Range:** Self, Point-Blank, or Close

**Action:** Automatic, Quick, Complex, or Task

**Duration:** Constant, Instant, Sustained, or your WIL $\div$ 5 in either action turns, minutes, or hours

**Infection Mod:** Added to your Infection Rating.

### Alter Effect
**Action:** Complex $\cdot$ **Duration:** Instant $\cdot$ **Infection Mod:** 2
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You trigger or ease a neurochemical response within the target, either decreasing or increasing the duration of a drug, chemical , or toxin by half.

### Animal Control
**Action:** Complex $\cdot$ **Duration:** Sustained $\cdot$ **Infection Mod:** 6

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You take over the mind of a non-sapient animal.  When sustained, you control the animal exactly like remotely operating a drone.  You may switch between autonomous mode and jamming.

### Aphasia
**Action:** Complex $\cdot$ **Duration:** Minutes $\cdot$ **Infection Mod:** 6

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You create a temporary stroke-like effect within the target's brain that disrupts their speech and language centers.  For WIL $\div$ 5 minutes, they are incapable of speaking, communicating, reading, and understanding language.

### Basilisk Stare
**Action:** Task $\cdot$ **Duration:** Sustained $\cdot$ **Infection Mod:** 6

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You make eye contact with the target and immobilize them.  As long as you keep your gaze locked on them (minor blinking aside), they cannot move, avert their eyes, or undertake any action (including mesh and mental actions).  You must also limit your movement, though you may move at half your base move and/or take quick physical actions, but you must make a REF Check to keep your eyes locked, and actions requiring a test and visual coordination suffer a -30 modifier.  Likewise, if the target is attacked, moved, or otherwise jostled, eye contact is lost.

You may not affect extra targets with this sleight, unless you have more than one set of eyes.

### Block Pain
**Action:** Complex $\cdot$ **Duration:** Minutes $\cdot$ **Infection Mod:** 4

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You impede the target's pain receptors.  For WIL $\div$ 5 minutes, the target can ignore the effects of one wound, plus one per superior success.  This is cumulative with other pain editing effects, up to a maximum of 3 wound effects.

### Block Sense
**Action:** Complex $\cdot$ **Duration:** Action Turns $\cdot$ **Infection Mod:** 4

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You short-circuit and temporarily disable one of the target's sensory cortices (your choice).  For WIL $\div$ 5 action turns, the target loses that type of sensory input.  The senses that may be negated include sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste, hunger, balance, direction, proprioception, facial recognition, and augmented senses such as electrical sense and radiation sense.  Any actions that rely on the impaired sense require a test with a minimum -30 modifier.

### Block Skill
**Action:** Complex $\cdot$ **Duration:** Minutes $\cdot$ **Infection Mod:** 6

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You install a temporary block in the target's brain, preventing them from using one specified skill (they may not even default) for WIL $\div$ 5 minutes.

### Browse Thoughts
**Action:** Complex $\cdot$ **Duration:** Sustained $\cdot$ **Infection Mod:** 4

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You scan the target's surface thoughts, gaining a general sense of what is currently running through their mind.  Superior successes provide deeper detail.  This is not an invasive delve into the target's mind for specific information like [Deep Scan](#deep-scan); instead, you simply get a read on what the target is currently thinking.

### Burst of Adrenaline
**Action:** Complex $\cdot$ **Duration:** Minutes $\cdot$ **Infection Mod:** 6

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You revive the target with a rush of endorphins and energy.  They receive +1 [Vigor pool](../Action%20&%20Combat/Pools.md#vigor) for WIL $\div$ 5 minutes.  A target may only benefit from one burst of adrenaline at a time.

### Burst of Clarity
**Action:** Complex $\cdot$ **Duration:** Minutes $\cdot$ **Infection Mod:** 6

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You refresh the target's mind, enabling them to see things in a new light.  They receive +1 [Insight pool](../Action%20&%20Combat/Pools.md#insight) for WIL $\div$ 5 minutes.  A target may only benefit from one burst of clarity at a time.

### Burst of Confidence
**Action:** Complex $\cdot$ **Duration:** Minutes $\cdot$ **Infection Mod:** 6

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You instill the target with renewed determination and empowerment.  They receive +1 [Moxie pool](../Action%20&%20Combat/Pools.md#moxie) for WIL $\div$ 5 minutes.  A target may only benefit from one burst of confidence at a time.

### Cloud Memory
**Action:** Complex $\cdot$ **Duration:** Minutes $\cdot$ **Infection Mod:** 6

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You temporarily disrupt the target's ability to form long-term memories.  The target will retain short-term memories during the duration (WIL $\div$ 5 minutes), but will soon (after d6 $+$ 4 action turns) forget anything that occurred while this sleight was in effect.


### Deep Scan
**Action:** Complex $\cdot$ **Duration:** Sustained $\cdot$ **Infection Mod:** 6

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep scan is a more intrusive version of [Browse Thoughts](#browse-thoughts).  You telepathically invade the target's mind and probe it for information.  You extract two pieces of information (i.e., a name, image, passcode, description or summary a few sentences long, or a memory of less than a minute) plus two for each superior success.  Each item takes one full action turn to retrieve, during which the sleight must be sustained.

### Deja Vu
**Action:** Complex $\cdot$ **Duration:** Minutes $\cdot$ **Infection Mod:** 8

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You force the target's mine into a recursive loop.  They will repeat their actions from the previous 15-30 seconds (5-10 action turns) for the next WIL $\div$ 5 minutes.  They will repeat their actions as closely as possible, even if their environment and circumstances change.  If someone actively interrupts or restrains the target, or otherwise disrupts the loop, they may make a WIL Check to break out of the loop, ending the sleight.


### Ego Sense
### Psi Shield
