# Aptitudes & Skills
Your aptitudes and skills represent your physical and mental attributes, as well as what actions or activities you have trained yourself in.  Aptitudes represent your natural, inherent abilities while skills represent abilities learned and honed through education and practice. Aptitudes range from 0 to 30, with a 15 representing an average transhuman.

There are 6 aptitude scores which are generated during character creation:
- **Cognition (COG)** represents your intelligence, problem-solving talent, and capacity for logical analysis.
- **Intuition (INT)** is your gut instinct and ability to evaluate on the fly.  It includes physical awareness, creativity, cleverness, and cunning.
- **Reflexes (REF)** is your coordination, manual dexterity, nimbleness, balance, and reaction speed.
- **Savvy (SAV)** represents your social awareness, adaptability, empathy, and ability to influence others.
- **Somatics (SOM)** is how well you can exploit your morph's physical capabilities, including strength, stamina, and sustained positioning and motion.
- **Willpower (WIL)** is your self-control, mental fortitude, and strength of personality.


<h3 id="#heading-id">Aptitude Checks</h3>
You will sometimes rely on your aptitudes to make tests rather than learned skills.  Aptitude checks normal only come into play in situations where no skill applies, but raw talent does.  Aptitude check values are a derived stat, based on your aptitude $\times$ 3.  Some examples include:

- **Cognition (COG) Check**: Recall a memory, memorize a number, or resist mental manipulation.
- **Intuition (INT) Check**: Evaluate a situation, see through an illusion, or grok alien intentions.
- **Reflexes (REF) Check**: Catch a thrown object, balance, avoid blinding glare, or stop yourself from falling.
- **Savvy (SAV) Check**: Evaluate a social situation, express empathy, follow etiquette, or resist social manipulation.
- **Somatics (SOM) Check**: Exercise brute strength, endure hardships, or break free from grapples.
- **Willpower (WIL) Check**: Keep your composure, steel your resolve, or resist fear or emotional manipulation.

## Skills
---
Skills represent your character's accumulated knowledge, education, and experience.  They are the most important part of your ego, traveling with you from morph to morph.  Having a well-rounded skill set is vital to survival in *Eclipse Phase*.

Your learned skills are built upon your inherent abilities (i.e., your core aptitudes).  Each skill is linked to an aptitude and increased by that aptitude's base value.  If an aptitude is modified, all linked skills are modified as well.

Skills are also assigned to a number of other *categories*, as noted on the [Skill List](#skill-list): Combat, Mental, Physical, Psi, Social, Technical, and Vehicle skills.  Certain traits, abilities, and modifiers may only apply to skills of a specific category.

> ### Skill Ranges
> Skills range in value from 0 to 100.
>
> | Rating | Assessment | Rating | Assessment |
> | :---: | :---- | :---: | :---- |
> |10 | Rudimentary Ability | 60 | Experienced Professional |
> | 20 | Some Familiarity | 70 | Expert |
> | 30 | Novice | 80 | Authority |
> | 40 | Basic Professional Competence | 90 |Master |
> |50 | Advanced Training | 100 | Pinnacle of Achievement |

### Field Skills
When you choose a field skill, you must select a particular emphasis for that skill known as a *field*.  Field skills are written as "[Skill]: [Field]."  For example, when choosing a Know skill, you must pick a particular discipline, such as Know: Engineering or Know: Biology.  Field skills may be purchased more than once, with a different field chosen each time.  Each field essentially serves as a separate skill.  Suggested fields are listed for each field skill, but players and GMs can cooperate to create others.

### Specializations
Yu may opt to specialize in a given skill.  Specializations represent a focus in one particular aspect of that skill and provide a +10 bonus when using that skill in a situation appropriate to the specialization.  For example, Beam Weapons is a specialization of the [Guns](#guns) skill.  Specializations are written in parentheses after the skill name -- e.g., Guns (Beam Weapons).  Each skill lists a number of possible specializations, but players and GMs can generate their own.  Field skills may also have specializations.

# Exotic Skill: [Field]
---
**Type:** Active, Field
This is a catch-all category for less-common skills.  This includes proficiency with unusual and archaic weaponry and skills that have a very narrow focus but require education, training, and experience to properly execute.

Use Exotic Skill if you want your character to be talented in a field that is not covered by any existing skill.  The GM determines the appropriate linked aptitude.

**Sample Fields:** Animal Handling (SAV), Bow (REF), Disguise (INT), Escape Artist (REF), Plasma Cutter (REF), Sleight of Hand (REF), Throwing Knives (REF), Whips (REF)

Infiltrate is best handled as a task action covering a specified distance, rather than rolling each action turn.

**Specializations:** Blend In, Hide, Shadow, Sneak


# Infosec
---
**Type:** Active, Technical

**Linked Aptitude:** Cognition

Infosec is short for "information security."  It incorporates training in electronic intrusion and counter-intrusion techniques, as well as use of cryptography tools.

**Specializations:** Forage, Hunt, Navigate, Track

---
## Know Skills
---

Know skills represent information your character has acquired, things they know.  They play a less dramatic role, but are often critical for helping your character solve mysteries, understand situations, and figure out what to do.

Points assigned for Active and Know skills are not interchangeable.  If you decided to take away points from a Know skill during character creation, you may only apply those extra points to another Know skill.

# Know: [Field]
---
**Type:** Know, Field

Know skill represents your accumulated knowledge in a field of work, study, or interest.  Know skills are loosely grouped into four types: academics, arts, interests, and professional training.

# Academics
---
**Linked Aptitude:** Cognition

Academic fields cover all of the disciplines of scientific knowledge and advanced study.  They include theoretical and applied sciences, social sciences, transhumanities, and technology.  Use Academics to call upon your education.  For example, Know: Chemistry could be used to identify a particular substance, understand an unusual chemical reaction, or determine what elements are needed to nanofabricate something that requires exotic materials.  The GM may choose not to allow defaulting on some Know Tests, as only someone who has been educated in that subject is likely to be able to tackle it.

**Sample Fields:** Archeology, Astrobiology, Astronomy, Astrophysics, Astrosociology, Biology, Botany, Chemistry, Computer Science, Cryptography, Economics, Engineering, Genetics, Geology, History, Law, Linguistics, Mathematics, Memetics, Nanotechnology, Physics, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, Xeno-archeology, Xenolinguistics, Zoology

**Specializations:** As appropriate to the field


### Using Know Skills
It may seem like Know skills have fewer in-game applications than Active skills, but they should not be underestimated.  They have three major uses, the first of which is analyzing clues and solving mysteries.  Many *Eclipse Phase* scenarios are based around technological dangers, alien encounters, and scientific phenomenon, and so characters will need a good balance of Know skills to unravel the problem and find solutions.

Just as importantly, Know skills are valuable in helping the characters -- and the players -- understand the world of *Eclipse Phase*.  In particular these skills can be used to assess a situation, identify strengths and weaknesses, make plans, evaluate worth, make comparisons, forecast probable outcomes, or understand the applicable science, socio-economic factors, or cultural or historical context.  In this regard, Know skills can be a valuable tool for GMs to assist the players, prompting for Know skill rolls to help flesh out details of the game setting that might otherwise be overlooked or not readily apparent.

For example, a group of characters looking to break into a facility could use Know: Security to evaluate the defenses, Know: Architecture to identify covert points of entry, Know: Sports to plan their infiltration at a time when the guards are likely to be distracted, Know: Triads to identify a local crime group that can sell them breaking and entering gear, and Know: Administrator to help identify a top-level exec who will have the security codes they need.  When used appropriately, these skills can be just as beneficial as the Active skills used to break inside, if not more so because the plan is more likely to succeed as a result of this preparation.

Finally, Know skills help bring flavor and character to the setting.  While Know: Martian Beers might not seem that useful at first, an enterprising character could use that expertise as an opening to talk to a potential source at a bar, to convince a suspicious Barsoomian cell the are not an off-world spy, or simply to amuse the others at the table with anecdotes about how certain exhumans strangely reek of Olympus Stout or the perils of consuming too much Pilsner Red Lager in zero g.

### Complementary Skills
In certain cases, Know skills can aid Active skill tests with a complementary skill bonus modifier.  This should only apply to situations where the Know skill provides information that would not normally be encompassed by the Active skill.  For example, Know: Religious Cults could be applied as a complementary skill when trying to Persuade a religious brinker group, but Know: Engineering is not complementary to a Hardware: Industrial Test to repair part of a habitat, because the hardware skill already incorporates such engineering knowledge.  The bonus for a complementary skill is based up its rating, as noted on the Complementary SKill Bonus table below.

> ### Complementary Skill Bonus Table
> | Know Skill | Modifier |
> | :---: | :---: |
> |40-59 | +10 |
> | 60-79 | +20 |
> |80+ | +30
