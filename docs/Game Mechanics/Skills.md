# Aptitudes & Skills
Your aptitudes and skills represent your physical and mental attributes, as well as what actions or activities you have trained yourself in.  Aptitudes represent your natural, inherent abilities while skills represent abilities learned and honed through education and practice.

There are 6 aptitude scores which are generated during character creation:
- **Cognition (COG)** represents your intelligence, problem-solving talent, and capacity for logical analysis.
- **Intuition (INT)** is your gut instinct and ability to evaluate on the fly.  It includes physical awareness, creativity, cleverness, and cunning.
- **Reflexes (REF)** is your coordination, manual dexterity, nimbleness, balance, and reaction speed.
- **Savvy (SAV)** represents your social awareness, adaptability, empathy, and ability to influence others.
- **Somatics (SOM)** is how well you can exploit your morph's physical capabilities, including strength, stamina, and sustained positioning and motion.
- **Willpower (WIL)** is your self-control, mental fortitude, and strength of personality.


## Aptitude Checks
You will sometimes rely on your aptitudes to make tests rather than learned skills.  Aptitude checks normal only come into play in situations where no skill applies, but raw talent does.  Aptitude check values are a derived stat, based on your aptitude $\times$ 3.  Some examples include:

- **Cognition (COG) Check**: Recall a memory, memorize a number, or resist mental manipulation.
- **Intuition (INT) Check**: Evaluate a situation, see through an illusion, or grok alien intentions.
- **Reflexes (REF) Check**: Catch a thrown object, balance, avoid blinding glare, or stop yourself from falling.
- **Savvy (SAV) Check**: Evaluate a social situation, express empathy, follow etiquette, or resist social manipulation.
- **Somatics (SOM) Check**: Exercise brute strength, endure hardships, or break free from grapples.
- **Willpower (WIL) Check**: Keep your composure, steel your resolve, or resist fear or emotional manipulation.
