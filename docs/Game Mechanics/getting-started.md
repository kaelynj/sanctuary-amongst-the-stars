# Getting Started
*Eclipse Phase* is played as a collaborative story-telling project that takes place in the player's imaginations.  The gamemaster (GM) details the setting, portrays the NPCs, adjudicates rules, and sets the stage for the adventure scenario.  The players take on the role of their characters and describe their actions.  Each character is defined by a set of characteristics -- skills, traits, etc. -- listed on their character sheet.  When the characters encounter difficulties or engage in conflicts with NPCs, dice are used to determine the outcome.

## Dice Basics
*Eclipse Phase* uses two ten-sided dice for skill tests and most other trolls.  Rolled dice are read as percentiles (d100), with the first die serving as the tens digit and the second as the ones digit.  Percentile dice rolls result in a number between 0 and 99 (00 is read as zero).  A roll of 5 and 3, for example, is read as 53.  Use different colored dice to note which one to read first or use ten-siders made for percentile rolling.
