# Sanctuary Amongst the Stars

This website is my own attempt at creating an easily searchable, organized collection of both game mechanics and campaign information (***Sanctuary Amongst The Stars***) for Eclipse Phase.  Currently the best way to peruse the repository is through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (though I have an eventual goal of moving towards organizing this with something like [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/)).  Feel free to submit PR's or Issues suggesting edits or additions to this collection of documents.

Eclipse Phase is written and published by [Posthuman Studios](https://posthumanstudios.com/) and this repository is can be freely shared under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license (see License.md).
