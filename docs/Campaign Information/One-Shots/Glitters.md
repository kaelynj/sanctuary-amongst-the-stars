# All That Glitters
The characters navigate political intrigues and spy games to target a diplomat at an exclusive soiree.

Planetary Consortium ambassador Alciato  is attending a private social event in the Saturn system.  They are believed to possess intel on plans to expand Consortium influence in the outer system.  The PCs are sent to recover those plans by any means necessary.

## Setting: Profunda
---
The party is being held in an extravagant ballroom in the subsurface beehive habitat of Profunda (on Saturn's moon Enceladus).  The gravity is a light 0.113g (less than Luna).  Profunda runs on Extropian principles -- there are no laws, only contracts.  The event is sponsored by the elite morph-design outfit, *Glitter Bloc*, which owns the location and provides its own security guards and drones.  party guests are contractually obligated to follow Glitter Bloc security dictums and resolve on-site legal disputes through their judiciary system on retainer.  Aside from the main ballroom, there are numerous side rooms for socializing, drinks & food, private chats, and freshening up.

## Sponsor

The PCs are recruited by either concerned anarchists/autonomists, Titanian Fleet Intelligence, Extropian hypercorp rivals, or Jovian Space Force Intelligence -- whichever works best.  Whomever sponsors them pulls rep strings to get them on the party's guest list.  They also hook them up with socialite Vox Maxine to introduce them and show them around.

## The Party
The Glitter Bloc's invite-only event is to announce and showcase new morph models to be released in the coming quarter.  Several hundred people are in attendance, with prominent figureheads, celebrities, and personalities from Profunda, the Saturnian system, and even the outer rim.  The event is streamed live on the mesh.  Everyone is dressed to kill.

# Timeline
---
The part proceeds as follows.  A few events that provide specific opportunities to introduce complications are bolded.

- **Guests Arrive**: Mingling, drinking appetizers
- Opening Speech: given by the Glitter Bloc's spokes-avatar
- Performance: harmonic overtone chorus with enhanced larynxes
- **Presentation**: The latest Profundan designer creatures -- aerial glow-puffers and winged spider gremlins.
- Performance: Six-armed taiko drummers
- **Main Runway Presentation**: New Glitter Bloc morph designs with AR and holo overlays.
- **VR Pod Exhibits**: Guests can experience and "test out" the new morph designs in virtual reality.
- **Performance**: Fork burlesque with Diva Von Teases
- Dance Party: dueling ring house DJs and designer drug samplers until the early hours.

# Tactics
---
The PCs have multiple paths towards retrieving the information from Alciato.  Possibilities include:
- Favor-trading between Alciato and other NPCs
- Forknapping Alciato
- Impersonating someone Alciato knows/trusts and using Deceive to get them to spill details
- Brainhacking Alciato while they use the VR pods
- Assaulting Alciato unseen and removing their encrypted data module implant
- Drugging Alciato to put them in a more "receptive" state

# Complications
---
GMs can use the following complications to provide distractions for the PCs, move the plot along, or otherwise stir things up:

- Halsema approaches Grix about defecting, asking for asylum.  Grix tells her she will arrange an extraction by the end of the party.
- The aerial glow-puffers and winged spider monkeys are intentionally released into the crowd, to some amusement and chaos.
- A pair of dating socialites have an extremely public (and possibly staged) spat and breakup, all caught on livestream.
- Alciato and Wadada take advantage of the main presentation to step aside and do some private negotiating.
- The hacker Riff-Raff takes advantage of the VR pods to have a private chat with Alciato
- A technical malfunction during the Divas' burlesque performance between the syncing of AR feeds and actual lights/holos/fog plunges the part into sensory chaos.

if the PCs trigger an open combat, Glitter Bloc security will step in to neutralize any combatants while other party-goers flee.  All of the diplomats present have small armed security details or drones, as do some of the other guests.

# Factions & NPCs
---
Representatives from other factions are also in attendance, each pursuing their own clandestine agendas.  Each lists a personality quirk, their primary agenda, and a secret.  GMs can use these to fuel roleplaying interactions and trigger events to push the plot.  Given the size constraints of this scenario, GMs will need to wing their own NPC and security stats.
