# Background
---
Gal Fiadre has established her culinary reputation on wildly exotic samplings and hot sauces so caustic they require an antidote soup course.  To protect her secret recipes, she staffs her kitchens only with forks of herself, sleeved in her distinctive, wild-eyed, custom sensate morph.

Firewall has tracked two of her morphs returning from a renowned dealer in dangerous goods.  Their operation confirmed Fiadre came away with a box containing biological samples potentially contaminated with a mind-altering exsurgent virus.  Fiadre's courier rocket flew immediately to the Helm Hotel, a navy-blue aerogel and gilded structure jutting from the surface of Nyhavn, where Fiadre's restaurant, Grind, serves the wealthiest gourmands in the Belt.  Tonight, Grind is closed to the public for a fundraising event.  The entire station is in microgravity.

# Mission Goal
The characters must stop the two smuggling Fiadres and capture or destroy their infectious payload at any cost.  The characters must not reveal they work for Firewall or the contents of the box, or the Firewall reconnaissance project may be jeopardized.  Firewall has already prepared legal resources on Nyhavn to free the characters from arrest, but arrest will remove the characters from play for the remainder of the mission.

# Beat 0: Hatching a Plan
---
Before beginning, there will be a mission debriefing with the player's firewall proxy, *Marona*.  As is standard procedure, this meeting takes place in a secure meeting space just underneath one of the local bars in a Faraday-proof room.  A secure-hardwired connection to the Firewall VPN is made and a hyper-local mesh network is constructed.  No data can be wirelessly sent in and no data can be wirelessly sent out.  Marona appears in an AR field and her voice is transmitted both to embedded speaker devices in the room as well as the player's implants.  She goes over the mission details, map of the hotel, and the player's objective.

After a brief scene of questions & answers about the mission, the crew are each given a set of 10 GP to spend on equipment, and a standard amount of 5 MP to spend on their morph upon arrival.  They now have an opportunity to plan out their heist.  However, before leaving, the crew must delete any and all local data about the mission that had been stored on their devices.

# Beat 1: Reservations
---
To arrive at Nyhavn, the crew can either egocast or smuggle onto a cargo shuttle scheduled to depart for Titan the following morning (a trip that is approximately 14 hours).  Regardless of their chosen mode of transport, they all begin this scene just outside the Helm Hotel.  Firewall mesh overwatch confirmed Fiadre's private shuttle docked at Helm's service yard minutes ago.  Two Fiadre morphs, carrying a single blue plastic crate, entered the service elevator to the restaurant.  The characters are ordered to immediately intercept and neutralize both Fiadres.

While there are several possible methods of entry, the easiest is the hotel entrance.  The characters must pass through the hotel's weapon scanner, managed by a door attendant.  Weapons may be smuggled in with an *Infiltrate Test* at -30 (no penalty for *Concealable* weapons).  Characters may make special accommodations with guest services for a modest fee (a moderate @-rep favor and an identity verification, which infomorphs or overwatch can hack) or leverage their disguises and a convincing cover story to get the hotel to authorize their weapons (requiring a *Persuade* or *Deceive Test* opposed with a WIL/SAV check of 45).  As the characters enter, they are each pinged on the mesh with a six-page standard-language contract and liability release defining the terms of their visit and rules of behavior.  There is nothing of special concern in the contract, but guest services will flag and follow anyone who refuses to digitally sign.

## Foyer
Grind is currently closed for a charity fundraiser and auction.  Only invited guests, and staff may enter, who are validated by their mesh IDs or a transponder-bearing invitation.  The door is AV 8/12, DR 60.  Characters may hack the hotel mesh to force or open or forge digital identities, or fast talk their way with guest services (requiring a *Persuade* or *Deceive* test opposed with a WIL/SAV Check of 45) (apply a +20 modifier if disguised as Fiadre).  Past the doorway, a spiraling shaft with strands of floating lights leads upwards to the [[Grinder#Diamond Room|Diamond Room]], the dining room for Grind.  A locked security room has a service elevator leading to the kitchen area.

## Diamond Room
The Diamond Room is a 30x20 meter ovoid room, with egg-shaped booths hosting the cream of visiting glitterati.  One end is blocked off where art and artifacts float, bathed in spotlights.  Five forks of Fiadre, all wearing their signature black chef's coat, carry spheres of flavors and smokes, racks of transgenic pork espalier, chocolate cake espuma, and other delicacies.  A ten-person security detail watches for any disturbances.  A single door exits from the middle to the kitchen, and there are two sealed fire exits.  *Perceive Tests* to locate the crate are at a -20 penalty due to the confusion and concealment in the room, but there is no blue crate present.


## Kitchen
The view into the kitchen is blocked by a gilded privacy wall.  As characters turn the corner and pass through the doors, they see signs painted in multiple languages; "Gal Fiadre Only: Visitors Unwelcome" and characters find their connection to the station mesh blocked, terminating access to overwatch.  To protect against espionage, wireless-inhibiting walls separate the kitchen's local network from the rest of the mesh.  Infomorph characters can ride with one of the characters across the threshold (once past, they may access the kitchen's mesh).

The main kitchen is 15x10 meters, with rows of floor-to-ceiling racks of appliances, many currently in use.  Most exposed walls have transparent cabinet doors storing additional ingredients and tools.  Narrow aisles between the racks and cabinets are barely wide enough for two chefs to pass.  Six Fiadres work around each other in the kitchen, speaking in a short-hand lingo common only to themselves and bursts of radio culinary chatter.  Fiadre has a +20 bonus to *Kinesics* tests made to recognize imposters (such as the characters, if they draw attention to themselves), and a +10 bonus to detecting the suspicious behaviors in either infected Fiadre.  They will immediately set on anyone they see who is obviously not Fiadre.  The racks of appliances have spaces that characters can shoot through, and provide Armor of 6/4.

> [!danger]
> As the characters enter, they should make a *Perceive Test* at -20 to see two Fiadres in the far corner, one carrying a blue plastic crate.  One enters a side door for the extruder room with the crate.  The other will stand watch.  If it's clear they've been detected, the Fiadre watching will point out any visible Firewall sentinels as spies, launching all the other Fiadres in the room to attempt to capture or kill them.  The infected Fiadre will continue to sow confusion or delay the characters as long as possible.


There are four smaller rooms off of the kitchen; an aquaculture garden, a freezer, a prep room, and the extruder.  There is also a service elevator back into the hotel.

## Extruder Room
The room is 2x2 meters and dominated by a machine festooned with nozzles and levers, capable of extruding any number of physics-defying foods.  There is a small wall hatch leading to the protein brewery.  The extruder is foaming a pink slime (the ice cream course, now exsurgent-contaminated).  The players can manually unplug the machine, but must go through the hatch to confront the final Fiadre.


# Beat 2: Dessert Course
---
From the extruder room, the characters enter Fiadre's private protein brewery.  The room is 10x10 meters, lined with 100-liter glass vats that bubble with custom protein brews.  Fiadre is scooping gobs of pink slime from her box and introducing them to each vat.

If Fiadre sees the characters, she will attack.  In addition, three of the vats will bubble out pink slime which will move with intention towards the characters.

# Tactics & Complications
---
The mission's focus is speed -- if Fiadre infects more people, the missions fails.

## Stealth & Disguises
Most of the rooms have lots of clutter, adding a +10 bonus to *Infiltrate Tests*.  Fiadre is well-recognized, but characters need to impersonate her to drive the disguise home.

## Mesh
The hotel is meshed and automated.  Hackers that can beat the Firewall of 60 can gain access to the security systems and an array of customer-service bots.  The kitchen is full of destructive mesh-enabled tools for any hacker capably of disabling their safety protocols.  GMs are encouraged to be creative and lenient with player improvisation.

## Combat
Grind is a cluttered microgravity environment -- should combat break out, stray shots will rupture food, machines, and bodies.  Floating flans, oils, and entrails may interfere with vision and movement.  Roll on the Combat table for effects of stray shots, adjusting results as appropriate.


# Resolution
---
if the characters do not stop Fiadre from infecting her clientele, they have failed the mission.  With Firewall unprepared to contain it, the infection will spread rapidly.  Several thousand will die from the initial wave, and several hundred more from the backlash of armed paranoia that follows.

Fiadre reached a more advanced infection than anticipated.  The characters may invite some cross looks for uncouth gun fights, but as long as Fiadre is stopped, Firewall will declare the mission a success.

Fiadre will flee any conflict in the dining rooms, but will fight to the death to defend her secret recipes in the kitchen.  She will believe other forks of herself, which the infected Fiadre will use to their advantage.  She will use her pistol at long range and will turn to whatever cooking implement -- culinary MASERs, immersion blenders, anti-griddles -- is at hand in melee.
