# Rules Primer
Use this page for a quick refresher on the basics of gameplay in *Eclipse Phase*.

## Making Tests

:::note Roll d100 (0-99)
- When asked for a test or check, roll d100 (0-99).  The target number to succeed is the corresponding skill, aptitude check value, or rep score found on your character sheet.  
- The difficulty of these checks are represented by *modifiers* to this target number, assigned by the GM.
- Your goal is to roll equal to or under the modified target number, but as high as possible.
- A roll equal to or under the target number is a success.
 - If the success roll is 33 or more, it is a *superior success*.
 - If the success roll is 66 or more, it is two superior successes.
- If the roll exceeds the target number it is a failure.
 - If the failed roll is under 66, it is a *superior failure*.
 - If the failed roll is under 33, it is two superior failures.
- Doubles (00, 11, 22, etc.) equal a *critical success* or *failure* depending on if the value is below or above the target number.
- 00 is always a critical success.  99 is always a critical failure.
- If you do not have the appropriate skill, you may *default* to the skill's linked aptitude, but critical successes are ignored.
- If you fail, you may try again (unless the GM disallows it), with a cumulative -10 modifier.

### Opposed Tests
- If you are acting in opposition to another character, you both make a test, rolling d100 against a skill +/- modifiers.
- Whomever succeeds *and* rolls highest wins.

### Modifiers
- Modifiers always affect the target number (skill), not the roll.
- Modifiers (positive or negative) come in 3 levels of severity:
  - Minor (+/- 10)
  - Moderate (+/- 20)
  - Severe (+/- 30)

### Specializations
- Specializations add +10 when using a skill for that area of concentration.  Each skill may only have one specialization.

### Superior Results
For one superior result, choose one of the following.  For two superior results, choose two or one twice for double effects:
- **Quality:** The work is more exact (success) or more sloppy (failure).  This may affect subsequent tests by +/- 10.
- **Quantity:** The test consumes fewer (success) or more (failure) materials or produces fewer or more results.
- **Detailed:** You acquire information that is much more in-depth/nuanced (success) or false (failure)
- **Time (task actions only):** The action takes a shorter (success) or longer (failure) amount of time by +/-25%
- **Covertness:** The action is less (success) or more (failure) obvious or draws less attention (+/- 10 as appropriate)
- **Damage:** Success inflicts more (+1d6) damage (failures miss).

### Critical Results
Criticals ("crits") have more impact than superior results.  They represent "Wow!" moments where you stun onlookers with incredible proficiency or ineptness.  They provide extra effects/penalties, as determined by the GM.  Here are some examples:

- Double the damage you inflict with an attack
- Gain a +/- 20 modifier to the next test you make
- Take an extra action (critical success) or lose your next action (critical failure)
- Break a weapon/tool (critical failure)

### Teamwork
- One character is chosen as the primary actor; they make the test.
- Each helper character adds a +10 modifier (max +30)
- For [Know](Skills.md#know-skills), Technical, or Vehicle skill tests, collaborating characters must possess the skill at 40+ to provide a teamwork bonus.

## Action Turns
Action turns are roughly 3 seconds in length.  In each action turn you may undertake one of the following:

- 1 complex action and 1 quick action
- 1 task action and 1 quick action
- 3 quick actions
- You may also take automatic actions

### Task Actions
Task actions are any actions that require longer than 1 action turn to complete.  They list a timeframe (anywhere from 2 turns to 2 years) and may be adjusted by superior results.

You may take extra time, applying a +10 modifier and taking 25% longer to complete the task.  You may also rush the job, reducing the timeframe by 25% but applying a -20 modifier.  If you fail, you expend 25% of the timeframe, +25% per superior failure, before you realize you have failed.

### Initiative
The order in which you act is determined by rolling 1d6 and adding your [Initiative](./action-and-combat/resolving-combat.md#initiative) stat.  The highest result goes first; others follow in descending order.  On tied initiatives, you go simultaneously or use REF or a roll-off to determine order.  You may also *delay* and act later in Initiative order, the count on which act becomes your Initiative on subsequent turns.


:::danger[Using Rep]
Use your rep scores to pursue favors such as acquiring goods, services, or info.  Each rep score applies only to the people/faction affiliated with that particular social network.  When you wish to pursue a favor:
- Make a Rep Test, using your rep score as the target number.
- They type of favor you are asking for modifies the target number: Minor (-10), Moderate (+0), or Major (-30).
- You can intentionally take a negative modifier to a Rep Test to keep your request quiet and hidden from others. The same modifier applies to anyone making a Rep Test to find out what you're up to.
- Favors have limits in how often they can be used: Minor (3 per week), Moderate (1 per week), Major (1 per story arc).
- You can burn rep (permanently lower your rep score) for additional favors (at the cost of 5 for Minor, 10 for Moderate, 20 for Major) or to get a modifier to a Rep Test(equal to burn points x2).

## Using Pools
Your character has a number of pools that define their transhuman capabilities.  Most pools are derived from your morph, but some Flex points can come from your ego.  Each pool is linked to a different group of aptitudes and skills and may be used in unique ways to modify your rolls or provide other bonuses.  However, each pool may only be used for tests that use their linked skill or aptitudes (i.e., a Vigor point can only be used on skill tests or aptitude checks linked with REF or SOM).  Flex may be used on any tests.

Unless otherwise noted, only 1 pool point may be spent per test.  Using a point allows you to choose one of the following:
- **Before Roll:** Ignore all modifiers to the test.
- **Before Roll:** Add +20 to the test's target number.
- **After Roll:** Flip-flop d100 roll.  For example an 83 becomes a 38.
- **After Roll:** Upgrade a success to a superior success (or one to two).
- **After Roll:** Downgrade a critical failure to a regular failure.
- **Ongoing (Insight, Moxie, Vigor Only):** Receive +5 (1 point) or +10 (2 points) to all skill tests linked to one aptitude for 24 hours or until your next recharge.

### Using Insight
Your Insight pool is linked to mental capabilities: Cognition, Intuition, and their linked skills.  You may choose one of the following instead of modifying a roll:
- **Take the Initiative:** Go first in an action turn if you are only taking a mental or mesh action and no physical movement.
- **Extra Action:** Take an extra complex mental or mesh action (or 2 quick actions) in an action turn.
- **Acquire a Clue:** Gain a hint or lead through investigation, research, or analysis of the facts at hand, without needing to make a test.

### Using Moxie
Moxie pool is linked to social interactions: Savvy, Willpower, and their linked skills.  You may choose one of the following instead of modifying a roll:
- **Ignore Trauma:** Ignore the effects of 1 trauma for 24 hours.
- **Refresh Rep:** Restore rep network favors at a cost of 1 point for a Minor favor and 2 points for a Moderate favor.  Major favors may not be refreshed this way.
- **Acquire a Clue:** Get a tip or lead by gathering information via social interactions without needing to make a test.
- **Control your Infection:** Avoid making an Infection Test when using a [psi sleight](psi/psi-overview.md) (asyncs only).
- **Negate Gaffe:** Ignore a player's social gaffe that the character wouldn't make. 

### Using Vigor
The Vigor pool is linked with physical effort: Reflexes, Somatics, and their linked skills.  Choose one of the following instead of modifying a roll:
- **Take the Initiative:** Go first in an action turn.
- **Extra Action:** Take an extra complex physical action (or 2 quick actions) in an action turn.
- **Ignore Wound:** Ignore the effects of 1 wound for 24 hours.

### Using Flex
The Flex pool is a wild-card pool.  It can be used to affect dice rolls for any tests or for narrative control:
- **Introduce an NPC:** A new or existing NPC joins the scene.  Their presence must be plausible.  You may define one aspect of this NPC: their morph, factional allegiance, a noteworthy skill, a specific trait, etc.
- **Introduce an Item:** A previously unnoticed item is added to the scene.  Its presence must be plausible.  The item cannot be offensive (no weapons) and it must be of Minor (nor Rare or Restricted) Complexity.  It can be a useful tool, a necessary piece of gear, or even a clue.
- **Define the Environment:** You may introduce an environmental factor to a scene.  Its presence must be plausible.  It should provide a new detail that doe not drastically alter the scene.  Examples including hiding spots, cover, distractions, shelter, or exploitable elements such as a ladder or window.
- **Define a Relationship:** You may include a new plausible, relationship between your character and an existing NPC.  This connection should be more loose or minor than close or serious.  For example, you may have a common friend, shared history, or old but minor rivalry.

## Refreshing Pools
You recover the points you spent from pools by taking a recharge action to rest and recalibrate.  You can't increase a pool above its original rating; unspent points are lost.  The two recharge actions you can take are:
- **Short Recharge (2/day):** Short recharges are a task action with a timeframe of 10 minutes.  You may take two short recharges per 24-hour period.  Each short recharge restores 1d6 pool points; you decide where to allocate them.
- **Long Recharge (1/day):** A long recharge is a task action with a timeframe of 4 hours (8 hours for flats and other biomorphs without biomods).  You may only benefit from one long recharge per 24-hour period.  A long recharge completely restores your pools to their full value.
