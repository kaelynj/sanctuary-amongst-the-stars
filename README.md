# Sanctuary Amongst the Stars

This repository is my own attempt at creating an easily searchable, organized collection of both game mechanics and campaign information/updates for my own personal campaign of Eclipse Phase, (***Sanctuary Amongst The Stars***).  Feel free to submit PR's or issues suggesting edits or additions to this collection of documents.

## Installation

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), an open-source static site generator to handle most of the web infrastructure. The only requirement is a system with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version 18.0 or above. If you have multiple projects which use JavaScript, consider using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Otherwise feel free to install [Node.js directly](https://nodejs.org/en). 

Then install dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```

## Preview dev site

Once the dependencies have been installed, preview the site with:
```bash
npm run start
```

## Build site

To build the site locally, run:
```bash
npm run build
```

And to serve the built website, execute:
```bash
npm run serve
```

## Run linter

A linter is included to ensure code quality
```bash
npm run lint
```
```
```
