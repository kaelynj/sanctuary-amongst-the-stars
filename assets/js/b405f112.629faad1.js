Rolled dice are read as percentiles (d100), with the first die serving as the tens digit and the second as the ones digit.  Percentile dice rolls result in a number between 0 and 99 (00 is read as zero).  A roll of 5 and 3, for example, is read as 53.

The gamemaster (GM) details the setting, portrays the NPCs, adjudicates rules, and sets the stage for the adventure scenario.  The players take on the role of their characters and describe their actions.  Each character is defined by a set of characteristics -- skills, traits, etc. -- listed on their character sheet.

They speak to a range of behaviors that put a face on the entity affecting you.  Players and GMSs are encouraged to use this to generate a personality of sorts for the infection itself.  Perhaps they hint at specific alien physiologies, motivations, or cultural mannerisms.  Though the exovirus should always remain inscrutable to some degree, its likely manifestations can provide indicators for its general outlook and intentions, which you can then use to add flavor to your PC\'s own actions.","sidebar":"gameSidebar"},"Game Mechanics/Psi/psi_chi":{"id":"Game Mechanics/Psi/psi_chi","title":"Psi-Chi Sleights","description":"Psi-chi sleights are available to anyone with the Psi trait.

Psi-chi sleights are passive, always-on, subconscious abilities available to anyone with the Psi trait.  They are considered automatic actions and require no effort to maintain.  Psi-chi sleights add bonuses to specific actions or enable new abilities rather than calling for a skill test.

Sleights that target other sentient beings or life forms are always opposed tests, while others are handled as success tests.  Active sleights require significant effort from the async and may cause their exovirus infection to flare up.","sidebar":"gameSidebar"},"Game Mechanics/Psi/Psi_overview":{"id":"Game Mechanics/Psi/Psi_overview","title":"Psi Overview","description":"In Eclipse Phase, psi abilities are the result of an infection by the mutant Watts-MacLeod strain of the exsurgent virus.

Unlike physical combat, there are no dueling avatars, no digital maneuvering, no deadly programs.  mesh combat represents efforts to undermine the stability of software -- infomorph mind-states (including #cyberbrains), account shells, apps (including the firewall), or operating systems themselves -- forcing them to crash.  Mesh combat follows the normal rules for combat, as described below.","sidebar":"gameSidebar"},"Game Mechanics/The Mesh/Hacking/Mindware Hacking":{"id":"Game Mechanics/The Mesh/Hacking/Mindware Hacking","title":"Mindware Hacking","description":"Pods, synthmorphs, and some bots, vehicles, and biomorphs are equipped with cyberbrains.  This technology enables transhuman egos to sleeve into and control these forms.  Under the hood, cyberbrains are specialized hardware (hosts) for running an infomorph\'s digital mind-state.

Most transhumans get online via the mesh insert implants within their head.  This headware enables them to network with other devices around them and store data and files.  Best of all, it\'s all mentally controlled.  You can browse mesh sites, play games, interface with gear, and talk with your friends, all within your head!  Messages are mentally recorded in your voice (or another of your choosing) or transcribed into text, all without speaking aloud.

At the least your mesh ID will be recorded, and possibly other data as well: type of device, length of connection, apps used, AR perceived, time, physical location, and possibly the mesh IDs of other systems you were connected to.  On top of this, apps and services -- particularly commercial ones -- keep a usage history and often surreptitiously log other data about you, which is then transmitted to their vendors and sold to advertising networks and other data brokers.  This may include friends lists, installed apps, browsing history, personal data, cached forms, and a \\"fingerprint\\" of your device that can be used to track you online even if you switch your mesh ID.","sidebar":"gameSidebar"},"Game Mechanics/The Mesh/Virtual Reality":{"id":"Game Mechanics/The Mesh/Virtual Reality","title":"Virtual Reality","description":"","sidebar":"gameSidebar"},"Game Mechanics/Transhuman Tech/Identity Systems":{"id":"Game Mechanics/Transhuman Tech/Identity Systems","title":"Identity Systems","description":"Digital Code ID","sidebar":"gameSidebar"},"Game Mechanics/Transhuman Tech/psychosurgery":{"id":"Game Mechanics/Transhuman Tech/psychosurgery","title":"Psychosurgery","description":"","sidebar":"gameSidebar"},"Game Mechanics/Transhuman Tech/reputation":{"id":"Game Mechanics/Transhuman Tech/reputation","title":"Reputation","description":"Where social networks shine is their value in networking for favors.
