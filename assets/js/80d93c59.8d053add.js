These buildings are climate controlled with stores of oxygen for life support and the colonists organized themselves into an egalitarian commune.

An omen of good fortune, a leaf seen within the aurora was spotted the night before a strange hole appeared.  One of the children, Timmy, began exploring and discovered what appeared to be some old, deactivated technology, long metallic snakes were found wrapped up within the icy walls of the hole.

However, while these projects were being undergone, a faction of synths separated from the group.  They left and built shelter within the ice storm, frustrated that the bio-based colonists would not listen to their needs.  Meanwhile, the mysterious hole began expanding and huskies began disappearing nightly.  Over the next few months, a fuel depot was constructed, initially to prepare a weapons stockpile, but which was eventually directed to become a shipyard.  Additionally, strange synthetic ice crocodiles emerged from the hole, alongside a giant head with wires coming out of it.  Possibly TITAN technology, the crocodiles and head had secretly been controlling the colonists who began worshipping them, led by their spiritual leader Sylvan.  Timmy was also in on it and the first year ends with an enslaved population of pets for the ice crocodiles.

Initially created as a secret military project, these early attempts at modifying and uplifting animals went horribly wrong.  The project was abandoned and all evidence was buried underneath the ice to (hopefully) never be found again.
