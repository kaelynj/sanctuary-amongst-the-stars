Percentile dice rolls result in a number between 0 and 99 (00 is read as zero).  A roll of 5 and 3, for example, is read as 53.

The players take on the role of their characters and describe their actions.  Each character is defined by a set of characteristics -- skills, traits, etc. -- listed on their character sheet.

Perhaps they hint at specific alien physiologies, motivations, or cultural mannerisms.

Best of all, it\'s all mentally controlled.  You can browse mesh sites, play games, interface with gear, and talk with your friends, all within your head!

On top of this, apps and services -- particularly commercial ones -- keep a usage history and often surreptitiously log other data about you, which is then transmitted to their vendors and sold to advertising networks and other data brokers.
