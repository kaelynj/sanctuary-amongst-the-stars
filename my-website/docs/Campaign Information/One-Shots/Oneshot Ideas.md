This document will list out initial ideas/pitches for one shots the party may decide to play through

### Meathab

- Something is going wrong in the meathab.  Mostly a funny setting, play lots of metal and heavy rock.

### Love & Rage

Gatecrashing adventure where the party goes to the Love & Rage collective's Pandora Gate


### Scum Swarm

A mystery or some other mission takes the party to a particularly violent scum swarm.  A community centered around mech pilots and fighting each other in cool mechs.  Many pilots have (voluntarily) addicted themselves to combat drugs and battlestims.  These special concoctions of psychedelics, narcotics, and amphetamines are designed to be dosed while piloting a mech to ensure maximum combat efficiency.  This keeps the fights increasingly fast, violent, and explosive all while the pilots get to be absolutely zonked out of their minds.

Tournaments are regularly held and teams design and fabricate their own mechs to try different combinations of weapons, drugs, and limb configurations.  Pilots are sleeved into the mech and keep a backup of themselves handy in case these fights to the death leave their cortical stack completely unrecoverable.  To keep themselves sharp and avoid addiction outside of combat, their typical morphs are designed to be highly resistant or completely immune to drugs.
